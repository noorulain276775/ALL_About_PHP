<h3>Name different data type in PHP</h3>
<p><b>Integer: </b>are the whole numbers, without a decimal point.</p>

<p><b>Boolean: </b>have two possible outcomes either true or false.</p>

<p><b>Indexed Array: </b> An array with numeric index values</p>
<p><b>Associative Array: </b> An array with string as index. This stores element values in association with key values rather than in a strict linear index order</p>
<p><b>Multidimensional Array: </b> It is called array of arrays. It allows you to have tabular data in an array. A multidimensional array each element in the main array can also be an array.</p>

<h3>Describe variable scope in PHP</h3>
<p>In PHP, Variables can be declared anywhere in the script. PHP has three different variable scope
<ul>
<li>Local</li>
<li>Global</li>
<li>Static</li>
</ul>
Variable declared outside a function has a global scope and can only be accessed outside a function.<br>
A variable declared within a function has a local scope and can only be accessed within a function.
</p>

<p><b>Global: </b>"Global" keyword, is used to access a global variable from within a function.</p>
<p><b>Static: </b>Normally, when a function is executed all of its variables are deleted. Howere sometimes, we want to keep a local variable NOT to be deleted. To do this, we use "Static" keyword.</p>
